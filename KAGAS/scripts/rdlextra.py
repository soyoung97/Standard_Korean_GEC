# wagnerfischer.py: efficient computation of Levenshtein distance and
# all optimal alignments with arbitrary edit costs. The algorithm for
# computing the dynamic programming table used has been discovered many
# times, but is described most clearly in:
#
# R.A. Wagner & M.J. Fischer. 1974. The string-to-string correction
# problem. Journal of the ACM, 21(1): 168-173.
#
# Wagner & Fischer also describe an algorithm ("Algorithm Y") to find the
# alignment path (i.e., list of edit operations involved in the optimal
# alignment), but it it is specified such that in fact it only generates
# one such path, whereas many such paths may exist, particularly when
# multiple edit operations have the same cost. For example, when all edit
# operations have the same cost, there are two equal-cost alignments of
# "TGAC" and "GCAC":
#
#     TGAC     TGxAC
#     ss==     d=i==
#     GCAC     xGCAC
#
# However, all such paths can be generated efficiently, as follows. First,
# the dynamic programming table "cells" are defined as tuples of (partial
# cost, set of all operations reaching this cell with minimal cost). As a
# result, the completed table can be thought of as an unweighted, directed
# graph (or FSA). The bottom right cell (the one containing the Levenshtein
# distance) is the start state and the origin as end state. The set of arcs
# are the set of operations in each cell as arcs. (Many of the cells of the
# table, those which are not visited by any optimal alignment, are under
# the graph interpretation unconnected vertices, and can be ignored. Every
# path between the bottom right cell and the origin cell is an optimal
# alignment. These paths can be efficiently enumerated using breadth-first
# traversal. The trick here is that elements in deque must not only contain
# indices but also partial paths. Averaging over all such paths, we can
# come up with an estimate of the number of insertions, deletions, and
# substitutions involved as well; in the example above, we say S = 1 and
# D, I = 0.5.
#
# Thanks to Christoph Weidemann (ctw@cogsci.info), who added support for
# arbitrary cost functions.
